A simple template project for the Stellaris LaunchPad using GCC and lm4flash.

I created the Makefile by examining the Makefile found in this project:
https://github.com/scompo/stellaris-launchpad-template-gcc

and the options used in the tutorial here:
http://recursive-labs.com/blog/2012/10/28/stellaris-launchpad-gnu-linux-getting-started/

The Makefile requires you have the SW-EK-LM4F120XL StellarisWare software
uncompressed somewhere as it expects to find two source files from it. The
STELLARISWARE variable in the Makefile should be changed to wherever you've
uncompressed that archive.  Also, you will need write access to wherever those
files are as it compiles them in place.

The StellarisWare software can be obtained here:
